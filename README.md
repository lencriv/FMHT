This repository contains code and data for analyzing neural recordings from mice engaged in naturalistic foraging behavior, investigating the neural representations underlying drive states (hunger/thirst) and actions.

## Repository Structure

### 📊 `primary_analysis/`
MATLAB code for analyzing and visualizing behavioral and electrophysiological data collected during the freely moving hunger and thirst paradigm.

### 🔄 `unitmatch_folder/`
MATLAB implementation extending the [UnitMatch framework](https://github.com/EnnyvanBeest/UnitMatch) to track individual neurons across multiple recording days.

### ⚡ `ephys_preprocessing/`
Python utilities for preprocessing electrophysiological data from neural recordings, including spike sorting and feature extraction.

### 🧠 `anatomy/`
Python code for registering neural recording sites to the Allen Brain Atlas, enabling anatomical localization of recorded units.

## Getting Started

*Instructions for installing dependencies and running the analysis will be provided here*
